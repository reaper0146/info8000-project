# INFO 8000 course project (Spring 2021)
## Introduction
**Group menmbers**: *Qi Li*, *Soumya pal*

In this project, we built a web application for users to simulate the tomato growth in the greenhouse.

By inputing the parameters such as temperature, CO2, simulation time range and location, users can get the numerical and visulization result including **total yield of the tomatoes**, **dry weight distribution** and **Growth of truss number**.
